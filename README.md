Below are the steps to run the script :-

1. Run the command to install the required python libraries -> 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run the main.py file using python with the following command -> 
```bash 
python main.py
```
3. After running the main.py file, we would get the following charts.

Note: This only works in linix systems as I've used the command to fetch the syslogs for the Linux OS. However, I have also included my log file so that the visualization can be performed. Make sure to comment code in main.py from line #11 to #20 in order to use the python script in non Linux OS.
